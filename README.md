# PygameTetris
A pygame version of tetris 

This is a version of tetris that is coded in pygame 
the base code is from here: 
https://thecodingfun.com/2021/11/04/use-pygame-to-create-tetris-game-an-updated-version/

there are a few added features:

Peices can be hard dropped by pressing space
the piece randomizer follows the same pattern as the real tetris which means the same piece cannot be shown thrice in a row

The features that i want to add:
ghost of the piece where it is about to be dropped
holding a piece
compatibility with a WASD control scheme to make it more covert while playing in class
make pieces take a second after landing to place so it is easier to t-spin and stuff
